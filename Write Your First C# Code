Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); // Output: Hello World!)
// console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
    // Causes an error due to C# being case-sensitive ((1,1): error CS0103: The name 'console' does not exist in the current context)
        /* When looking at error mesages, 
        The first part (1,1) indicates the line and column (character) 
        where the error occurred. */

// Console.WriteLine('Hello World!');
    // Causes an error due to the use of single-quotation marks (') to surround literal strings
    // reads it as a character literal
    // Error Message: (1,19): error CS1012: Too many characters in character literal

// The key difference between Console.Write and Console.WriteLine is that:
        // Console.WriteLine appends a new line after the output.
